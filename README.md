Mistakes in UI:
1. Different margins, paddings, colors, allignments in the elements of the same type
2. Ð¡ontrast ratio text/background does not meet the requirement of contrast ratio 4,5:1

First problem was solved by using styles and dimens in res folder. 
Second problem was solved by selecting colors for text and background.
